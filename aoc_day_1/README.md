# AOC Day 1 Solution (Part 1 and 2)
### Test Instructions
The folders are structured simularly to the [example](https://github.com/janestreet/hardcaml_template_project/tree/with-extensions)

The testbenches for parts 1 and 2 are zero_ctr_2.ml and zero_ctr_2.mli respectively. To run them,

```bash
    cd aoc_day_1
    dune runtest
```

Note: Each testbench currently prints its output to a file, whose absolute path is specified within the testbench. This should be modified to an appropriate absolute path on the user's end before running the test.
